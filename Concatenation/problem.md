# Concatenation
You are given $N$ non-empty strings. Determine the $K$-th lexigogical strings post concatenation. 

The output string is differentiated for every combination.

## Constraints
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq |s_i|$
- $\sum_{i=1}^{N} |s_i| \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq K \leq \min(10^5, N!)$
- each string consists of English lowercase characters
