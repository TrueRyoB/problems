# Houseplant
You have bought $N$ seeds. Every day, each seed has its property $D_i$.

Every day, each plant $i$ grows its height by $\lceil h_i R \rceil + D_i$, where $h_i$ is its current height.

When do you achieve the cumulative height of more than or equal to $E$?

## Constraints
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $0 \leq R \leq 1.0$
- $1 \leq D_i \leq 10^{10}$
- $1 \leq E \leq 10^{10}$
