# Robot
There are $N$ robots. As a factory owner, your today's quota is to make at least $M$ components.
Robot $i$ takes $A_i$ turns to make one component at the probability of $P_i$.

Now every robot has began operating in parallel.

Solve the expected minimum number of turns to make $M$ components at modulo 998244353.

## Requirement
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq M \leq 10^{10}$
- $1\leq A_i \leq 10^{10}$
- $0 \leq P_i \lt 998244353$
