# Constraint
You are to design a program that yields at least one set of variables satisfying constraints provided.

Constraints are given for each variable as a range bounded by functions that take either constants or existing variables as their input.


1. Prove why it is impossible to design this program.
2. Suggest one constraint to the constraint so that designing the program becomes possible.
