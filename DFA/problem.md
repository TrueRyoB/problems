# DFA
You are building a deterministic finite automata.

The language consists of only "0" and "1". 

A machine should accept strings if it contains at least $A$ of "0" and at most $B$ of "1".

Solve the least number of states you need to build the machine.

## Constraints
- $0 \leq A, B \leq 10^{10^{3}}$
